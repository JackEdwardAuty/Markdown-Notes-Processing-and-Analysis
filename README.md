# Markdown-Notes-Processing-and-Analysis
This is a personal project that tackles extracting meaningful data from my personal Obsidian vault. In my vault I have tracked medication, meal and sleep times and some other specifics through multiple daily notes templates. Data Extraction and some Transformation handled with Python. Excel, Tableau, PowerBI for visualisation and further analysis.
